# Examples of Managing Azure Resources using Go

These examples are not to supercede the examples located at the [Azure GO Samples Repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go).

This is just a repository where I plan to put my investigations into [Go](https://golang.org/) as it relates to doing things with Azure.

Some of the examples require a .env file similar to the following file.

``` env
AZ_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=
AZ_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME=
AZ_LOCATION=westus
AZ_TENANT_ID=
AZ_CLIENT_ID=
AZ_CLIENT_SECRET=
AZ_SAMPLES_KEEP_RESOURCES=

AZ_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME=
```
